I'm  Amresha Soomro. An accomplished Senior IT Project Manager offering 10 years of experience in Software Project Management. Successful when leading high-performing teams to sustain product vision, roadmap and business goals. Exceptional technical expertise, leadership and talent for driving stellar, on-target results.


Outside work, I am an avid traveller and an adventure enthusiast. I have travelled 5 cities in Turkey and 5 Countries of European Union. From what I have experienced, I believe in being accepting and open to new experiences, as each carries a uniqueness that one can truly embrace.

Last but not least, here are some of my pictures :)
